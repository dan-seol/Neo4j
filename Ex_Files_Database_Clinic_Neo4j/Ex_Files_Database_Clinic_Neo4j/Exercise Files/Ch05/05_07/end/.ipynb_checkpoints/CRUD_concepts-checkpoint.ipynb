      "292: That will ask some tears in the true performing of\n",
      "293: it: if I do it, let the audience look to their\n",
      "294: eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some\n",
      "295: measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a\n",
      "296: tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to\n",
      "297: tear a cat in, to make all split.\n",

      "310: Here, Peter QUINCE.\n",
      "311: FLUTE, you must take Thisby on you.\n",
      "312: What is Thisby? a wandering knight?\n",
      "313: It is the lady that Pyramus must love.\n",
      "314: Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.\n",
      "315: That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and\n",
      "316: you may speak as small as you will.\n",
      "317: An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll\n",

      "337: let him roar again.'\n",
      "338: An you should do it too terribly, you would fright\n",

      "483: And the quaint mazes in the wanton green\n",
      "484: For lack of tread are undistinguishable:\n",
      "485: The human mortals want their winter here;\n",
      "486: No night is now with hymn or carol blest:\n",
      "487: Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,\n",
      "488: Pale in her anger, washes all the air,\n",
      "489: That rheumatic diseases do abound:\n",
      "490: And thorough this distemperature we see\n",
      "491: The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts\n",
      "492: Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,\n",
      "493: And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown\n",
      "494: An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds\n",
      "495: Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,\n",
      "496: The childing autumn, angry winter, change\n",
      "497: Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,\n",
      "498: By their increase, now knows not which is which:\n",
      "499: And this same progeny of evils comes\n",
      "500: From our debate, from our dissension;\n",
      "501: We are their parents and original.\n",
      "502: Do you amend it then; it lies in you:\n",
      "503: Why should TITANIA cross her OBERON?\n",
      "504: I do but beg a little changeling boy,\n",
      "505: To be my henchman.\n",
      "506: Set your heart at rest:\n",
      "507: The fairy land buys not the child of me.\n",
      "508: His mother was a votaress of my order:\n",
      "509: And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,\n",
      "510: Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,\n",
      "511: And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,\n",
      "512: Marking the embarked traders on the flood,\n",
      "513: When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive\n",
      "514: And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;\n",
      "515: Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait\n",
      "516: Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--\n",
      "517: Would imitate, and sail upon the land,\n",
      "518: To fetch me trifles, and return again,\n",
      "519: As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.\n",
      "520: But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;\n",
      "521: And for her sake do I rear up her boy,\n",
      "522: And for her sake I will not part with him.\n",
      "523: How long within this wood intend you stay?\n",
      "524: Perchance till after THESEUS' wedding-day.\n",
      "525: If you will patiently dance in our round\n",
      "526: And see our moonlight revels, go with us;\n",
      "527: If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.\n",
      "528: Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.\n",
      "529: Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!\n",
      "530: We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.\n",
      "532: Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove\n",
      "533: Till I torment thee for this injury.\n",
      "534: My gentle PUCK, come hither. Thou rememberest\n",
      "535: Since once I sat upon a promontory,\n",
      "536: And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back\n",
      "537: Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath\n",
      "538: That the rude sea grew civil at her song\n",
      "539: And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,\n",
      "540: To hear the sea-maid's music.\n",
      "541: I remember.\n",
      "542: That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,\n",
      "543: Flying between the cold moon and the earth,\n",
      "544: Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took\n",
      "545: At a fair vestal throned by the west,\n",
      "546: And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,\n",
      "547: As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;\n",
      "548: But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft\n",
      "549: Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,\n",
      "550: And the imperial votaress passed on,\n",
      "551: In maiden meditation, fancy-free.\n",
      "552: Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:\n",
      "553: It fell upon a little western flower,\n",
      "554: Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,\n",
      "555: And maidens call it love-in-idleness.\n",
      "556: Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:\n",
      "557: The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid\n",
      "558: Will make or man or woman madly dote\n",
      "559: Upon the next live creature that it sees.\n",
      "560: Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again\n",
      "561: Ere the leviathan can swim a league.\n",
      "562: I'll put a girdle round about the earth\n",
      "563: In forty minutes.\n",
      "565: Having once this juice,\n",
      "566: I'll watch TITANIA when she is asleep,\n",
      "567: And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.\n",
      "568: The next thing then she waking looks upon,\n",
      "569: Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,\n",
      "570: On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,\n",
      "571: She shall pursue it with the soul of love:\n",
      "572: And ere I take this charm from off her sight,\n",
      "573: As I can take it with another herb,\n",
      "574: I'll make her render up her page to me.\n",
      "575: But who comes here? I am invisible;\n",
      "576: And I will overhear their conference.\n",
      "578: I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.\n",
      "579: Where is LYSANDER and fair HERMIA?\n",
      "580: The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.\n",
      "581: Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;\n",
      "582: And here am I, and wode within this wood,\n",
      "583: Because I cannot meet my HERMIA.\n",
      "584: Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.\n",
      "585: You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;\n",
      "586: But yet you draw not iron, for my heart\n",
      "587: Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,\n",
      "588: And I shall have no power to follow you.\n",
      "589: Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?\n",
      "590: Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth\n",
      "591: Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?\n",
      "592: And even for that do I love you the more.\n",
      "593: I am your spaniel; and, DEMETRIUS,\n",
      "594: The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:\n",
      "595: Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,\n",
      "596: Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,\n",
      "597: Unworthy as I am, to follow you.\n",
      "598: What worser place can I beg in your love,--\n",
      "599: And yet a place of high respect with me,--\n",
      "600: Than to be used as you use your dog?\n",
      "601: Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;\n",
      "602: For I am sick when I do look on thee.\n",
      "603: And I am sick when I look not on you.\n",
      "604: You do impeach your modesty too much,\n",
      "605: To leave the city and commit yourself\n",
      "606: Into the hands of one that loves you not;\n",
      "607: To trust the opportunity of night\n",
      "608: And the ill counsel of a desert place\n",
      "609: With the rich worth of your virginity.\n",
      "610: Your virtue is my privilege: for that\n",
      "611: It is not night when I do see your face,\n",
      "612: Therefore I think I am not in the night;\n",
      "613: Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,\n",
      "614: For you in my respect are all the world:\n",
      "615: Then how can it be said I am alone,\n",
      "616: When all the world is here to look on me?\n",
      "617: I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,\n",
      "618: And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.\n",
      "619: The wildest hath not such a heart as you.\n",
      "620: Run when you will, the story shall be changed:\n",
      "621: Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;\n",
      "622: The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind\n",
      "623: Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,\n",
      "624: When cowardice pursues and valour flies.\n",
      "625: I will not stay thy questions; let me go:\n",
      "626: Or, if thou follow me, do not believe\n",
      "627: But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.\n",
      "628: Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,\n",
      "629: You do me mischief. Fie, DEMETRIUS!\n",
      "630: Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:\n",
      "631: We cannot fight for love, as men may do;\n",
      "632: We should be wood and were not made to woo.\n",
      "634: I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,\n",
      "635: To die upon the hand I love so well.\n",
      "637: Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,\n",
      "638: Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.\n",
      "639: Re-enter PUCK\n",
      "640: Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.\n",
      "641: Ay, there it is.\n",
      "642: I pray thee, give it me.\n",
      "643: I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,\n",
      "644: Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,\n",
      "645: Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,\n",
      "646: With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:\n",
      "647: There sleeps TITANIA sometime of the night,\n",
      "648: Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;\n",
      "649: And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,\n",
      "650: Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:\n",
      "651: And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,\n",
      "652: And make her full of hateful fantasies.\n",
      "653: Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:\n",
      "654: A sweet Athenian lady is in love\n",
      "655: With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;\n",
      "656: But do it when the next thing he espies\n",
      "657: May be the lady: thou shalt know the man\n",
      "658: By the Athenian garments he hath on.\n",
      "659: Effect it with some care, that he may prove\n",
      "660: More fond on her than she upon her love:\n",
      "661: And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.\n",
      "662: Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.\n",
      "663: Exeunt\n",
      "665: \n",
      "667: Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;\n",
      "668: Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;\n",
      "669: Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,\n",
      "670: Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,\n",
      "671: To make my small elves coats, and some keep back\n",
      "672: The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders\n",
      "673: At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;\n",
      "674: Then to your offices and let me rest.\n",
      "675: The Fairies sing\n",
      "676: You spotted snakes with double tongue,\n",
      "677: Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;\n",
      "678: Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,\n",
      "679: Come not near our fairy queen.\n",
      "680: Philomel, with melody\n",
      "681: Sing in our sweet lullaby;\n",
      "682: Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:\n",
      "683: Never harm,\n",
      "684: Nor spell nor charm,\n",
      "685: Come our lovely lady nigh;\n",
      "686: So, good night, with lullaby.\n",
      "687: Weaving spiders, come not here;\n",
      "688: Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!\n",
      "689: Beetles black, approach not near;\n",
      "690: Worm nor snail, do no offence.\n",
      "691: Philomel, with melody, & c.\n",
      "692: Fairy\n",
      "693: Hence, away! now all is well:\n",
      "694: One aloof stand sentinel.\n",
      "695: Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps\n",
      "697: What thou seest when thou dost wake,\n",
      "698: Do it for thy true-love take,\n",
      "699: Love and languish for his sake:\n",
      "700: Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,\n",
      "701: Pard, or boar with bristled hair,\n",
      "702: In thy eye that shall appear\n",
      "703: When thou wakest, it is thy dear:\n",
      "704: Wake when some vile thing is near.\n",
      "707: Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;\n",
      "708: And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:\n",
      "709: We'll rest us, HERMIA, if you think it good,\n",
      "710: And tarry for the comfort of the day.\n",
      "711: Be it so, LYSANDER: find you out a bed;\n",
      "712: For I upon this bank will rest my head.\n",
      "713: One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;\n",
      "714: One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.\n",
      "715: Nay, good LYSANDER; for my sake, my dear,\n",
      "716: Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.\n",
      "717: O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!\n",
      "718: Love takes the meaning in love's conference.\n",
      "719: I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit\n",
      "720: So that but one heart we can make of it;\n",
      "721: Two bosoms interchained with an oath;\n",
      "722: So then two bosoms and a single troth.\n",
      "723: Then by your side no bed-room me deny;\n",
      "724: For lying so, HERMIA, I do not lie.\n",
      "725: LYSANDER riddles very prettily:\n",
      "726: Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,\n",
      "727: If HERMIA meant to say LYSANDER lied.\n",
      "728: But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy\n",
      "729: Lie further off; in human modesty,\n",
      "730: Such separation as may well be said\n",
      "731: Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,\n",
      "732: So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:\n",
      "733: Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!\n",
      "734: Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;\n",
      "735: And then end life when I end loyalty!\n",
      "736: Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!\n",
      "737: With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!\n",
      "738: They sleep\n",
      "740: Through the forest have I gone.\n",
      "741: But Athenian found I none,\n",
      "742: On whose eyes I might approve\n",
      "743: This flower's force in stirring love.\n",
      "744: Night and silence.--Who is here?\n",
      "745: Weeds of Athens he doth wear:\n",
      "746: This is he, my master said,\n",
      "747: Despised the Athenian maid;\n",
      "748: And here the maiden, sleeping sound,\n",
      "749: On the dank and dirty ground.\n",
      "750: Pretty soul! she durst not lie\n",
      "751: Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.\n",
      "752: Churl, upon thy eyes I throw\n",
      "753: All the power this charm doth owe.\n",
      "754: When thou wakest, let love forbid\n",
      "755: Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:\n",
      "756: So awake when I am gone;\n",
      "757: For I must now to OBERON.\n",
      "760: Stay, though thou kill me, sweet DEMETRIUS.\n",
      "761: I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.\n",
      "762: O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.\n",
      "763: Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.\n",
      "765: O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!\n",
      "766: The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.\n",
      "767: Happy is HERMIA, wheresoe'er she lies;\n",
      "768: For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.\n",
      "769: How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:\n",
      "770: If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.\n",
      "771: No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;\n",
      "772: For beasts that meet me run away for fear:\n",
      "773: Therefore no marvel though DEMETRIUS\n",
      "774: Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.\n",
      "775: What wicked and dissembling glass of mine\n",
      "776: Made me compare with HERMIA's sphery eyne?\n",
      "777: But who is here? LYSANDER! on the ground!\n",
      "778: Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.\n",
      "779: LYSANDER if you live, good sir, awake.\n",
      "780: [Awaking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.\n",
      "781: Transparent HELENA! Nature shows art,\n",
      "782: That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.\n",
      "783: Where is DEMETRIUS? O, how fit a word\n",
      "784: Is that vile name to perish on my sword!\n",
      "785: Do not say so, LYSANDER; say not so\n",
      "786: What though he love your HERMIA? Lord, what though?\n",
      "787: Yet HERMIA still loves you: then be content.\n",
      "788: Content with HERMIA! No; I do repent\n",
      "789: The tedious minutes I with her have spent.\n",
      "790: Not HERMIA but HELENA I love:\n",
      "791: Who will not change a raven for a dove?\n",
      "792: The will of man is by his reason sway'd;\n",
      "793: And reason says you are the worthier maid.\n",
      "794: Things growing are not ripe until their season\n",
      "795: So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;\n",
      "796: And touching now the point of human skill,\n",
      "797: Reason becomes the marshal to my will\n",
      "798: And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook\n",
      "799: Love's stories written in love's richest book.\n",
      "800: Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?\n",
      "801: When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?\n",
      "802: Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,\n",
      "803: That I did never, no, nor never can,\n",
      "804: Deserve a sweet look from DEMETRIUS' eye,\n",
      "805: But you must flout my insufficiency?\n",
      "806: Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,\n",
      "807: In such disdainful manner me to woo.\n",
      "808: But fare you well: perforce I must confess\n",
      "809: I thought you lord of more true gentleness.\n",
      "810: O, that a lady, of one man refused.\n",
      "811: Should of another therefore be abused!\n",
      "813: She sees not HERMIA. HERMIA, sleep thou there:\n",
      "814: And never mayst thou come LYSANDER near!\n",
      "815: For as a surfeit of the sweetest things\n",
      "816: The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,\n",
      "817: Or as tie heresies that men do leave\n",
      "818: Are hated most of those they did deceive,\n",
      "819: So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,\n",
      "820: Of all be hated, but the most of me!\n",
      "821: And, all my powers, address your love and might\n",
      "822: To honour Helen and to be her knight!\n",
      "824: [Awaking] Help me, LYSANDER, help me! do thy best\n",
      "825: To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!\n",
      "826: Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!\n",
      "827: LYSANDER, look how I do quake with fear:\n",
      "828: Methought a serpent eat my heart away,\n",
      "829: And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.\n",
      "830: LYSANDER! what, removed? LYSANDER! lord!\n",
      "831: What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?\n",
      "832: Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;\n",

      "1176: Shall we their fond pageant see?\n",
      "1177: Lord, what fools these mortals be!\n",
      "1178: Stand aside: the noise they make\n",
      "1179: Will cause DEMETRIUS to awake.\n",
      "1180: Then will two at once woo one;\n",
      "1181: That must needs be sport alone;\n",
      "1182: And those things do best please me\n",
      "1183: That befal preposterously.\n",
      "1185: Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?\n",
      "1186: Scorn and derision never come in tears:\n",
      "1187: Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,\n",
      "1188: In their nativity all truth appears.\n",
      "1189: How can these things in me seem scorn to you,\n",
      "1190: Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?\n",
      "1191: You do advance your cunning more and more.\n",
      "1192: When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!\n",
      "1193: These vows are HERMIA's: will you give her o'er?\n",
      "1194: Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:\n",
      "1195: Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,\n",
      "1196: Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.\n",
      "1197: I had no judgment when to her I swore.\n",
      "1198: Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.\n",
      "1199: DEMETRIUS loves her, and he loves not you.\n",
      "1200: [Awaking] O HELENA, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!\n",
      "1201: To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?\n",
      "1202: Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show\n",
      "1203: Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!\n",
      "1204: That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,\n",
      "1205: Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow\n",
      "1206: When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss\n",
      "1207: This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!\n",
      "1208: O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent\n",
      "1209: To set against me for your merriment:\n",
      "1210: If you we re civil and knew courtesy,\n",
      "1211: You would not do me thus much injury.\n",
      "1212: Can you not hate me, as I know you do,\n",
      "1213: But you must join in souls to mock me too?\n",
      "1214: If you were men, as men you are in show,\n",
      "1215: You would not use a gentle lady so;\n",
      "1216: To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,\n",
      "1217: When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.\n",
      "1218: You both are rivals, and love HERMIA;\n",
      "1219: And now both rivals, to mock HELENA:\n",
      "1220: A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,\n",
      "1221: To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes\n",
      "1222: With your derision! none of noble sort\n",
      "1223: Would so offend a virgin, and extort\n",
      "1224: A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.\n",
      "1225: You are unkind, DEMETRIUS; be not so;\n",
      "1226: For you love HERMIA; this you know I know:\n",
      "1227: And here, with all good will, with all my heart,\n",
      "1228: In HERMIA's love I yield you up my part;\n",
      "1229: And yours of HELENA to me bequeath,\n",
      "1230: Whom I do love and will do till my death.\n",
      "1231: Never did mockers waste more idle breath.\n",
      "1232: LYSANDER, keep thy HERMIA; I will none:\n",
      "1233: If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.\n",
      "1234: My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,\n",
      "1235: And now to Helen is it home return'd,\n",
      "1236: There to remain.\n",
      "1237: Helen, it is not so.\n",
      "1238: Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,\n",
      "1239: Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.\n",
      "1240: Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.\n",
      "1241: Re-enter HERMIA\n",
      "1242: Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,\n",
      "1243: The ear more quick of apprehension makes;\n",
      "1244: Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,\n",
      "1245: It pays the hearing double recompense.\n",
      "1246: Thou art not by mine eye, LYSANDER, found;\n",
      "1247: Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound\n",
      "1248: But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?\n",
      "1249: Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?\n",
      "1250: What love could press LYSANDER from my side?\n",
      "1251: LYSANDER's love, that would not let him bide,\n",
      "1252: Fair HELENA, who more engilds the night\n",
      "1253: Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.\n",
      "1254: Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,\n",
      "1255: The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?\n",
      "1256: You speak not as you think: it cannot be.\n",
      "1257: Lo, she is one of this confederacy!\n",
      "1258: Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three\n",
      "1259: To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.\n",
      "1260: Injurious HERMIA! most ungrateful maid!\n",
      "1261: Have you conspired, have you with these contrived\n",
      "1262: To bait me with this foul derision?\n",
      "1263: Is all the counsel that we two have shared,\n",
      "1264: The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,\n",
      "1265: When we have chid the hasty-footed time\n",
      "1266: For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?\n",
      "1267: All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?\n",
      "1268: We, HERMIA, like two artificial gods,\n",
      "1269: Have with our needles created both one flower,\n",
      "1270: Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,\n",
      "1271: Both warbling of one song, both in one key,\n",
      "1272: As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,\n",
      "1273: Had been incorporate. So we grow together,\n",
      "1274: Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,\n",
      "1275: But yet an union in partition;\n",
      "1276: Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;\n",
      "1277: So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;\n",
      "1278: Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,\n",
      "1279: Due but to one and crowned with one crest.\n",
      "1280: And will you rent our ancient love asunder,\n",
      "1281: To join with men in scorning your poor friend?\n",
      "1282: It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:\n",
      "1283: Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,\n",
      "1284: Though I alone do feel the injury.\n",
      "1285: I am amazed at your passionate words.\n",
      "1286: I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.\n",
      "1287: Have you not set LYSANDER, as in scorn,\n",
      "1288: To follow me and praise my eyes and face?\n",
      "1289: And made your other love, DEMETRIUS,\n",
      "1290: Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,\n",
      "1291: To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,\n",
      "1292: Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this\n",
      "1293: To her he hates? and wherefore doth LYSANDER\n",
      "1294: Deny your love, so rich within his soul,\n",
      "1295: And tender me, forsooth, affection,\n",
      "1296: But by your setting on, by your consent?\n",
      "1297: What thought I be not so in grace as you,\n",
      "1298: So hung upon with love, so fortunate,\n",
      "1299: But miserable most, to love unloved?\n",
      "1300: This you should pity rather than despise.\n",
      "1301: HERNIA\n",
      "1302: I understand not what you mean by this.\n",
      "1303: Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,\n",
      "1304: Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;\n",
      "1305: Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:\n",
      "1306: This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.\n",
      "1307: If you have any pity, grace, or manners,\n",
      "1308: You would not make me such an argument.\n",
      "1309: But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;\n",
      "1310: Which death or absence soon shall remedy.\n",
      "1311: Stay, gentle HELENA; hear my excuse:\n",
      "1312: My love, my life my soul, fair HELENA!\n",
      "1313: O excellent!\n",
      "1314: Sweet, do not scorn her so.\n",
      "1315: If she cannot entreat, I can compel.\n",
      "1316: Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:\n",
      "1317: Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.\n",
      "1318: Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:\n",
      "1319: I swear by that which I will lose for thee,\n",
      "1320: To prove him false that says I love thee not.\n",
      "1321: I say I love thee more than he can do.\n",
      "1322: If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.\n",
      "1323: Quick, come!\n",
      "1324: LYSANDER, whereto tends all this?\n",
      "1325: Away, you Ethiope!\n",
      "1326: No, no; he'll [ ]\n",
      "1327: Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,\n",
      "1328: But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!\n",
      "1329: Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,\n",
      "1330: Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!\n",
      "1331: Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?\n",
      "1332: Sweet love,--\n",
      "1333: Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!\n",
      "1334: Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!\n",
      "1335: Do you not jest?\n",
      "1336: Yes, sooth; and so do you.\n",
      "1337: DEMETRIUS, I will keep my word with thee.\n",
      "1338: I would I had your bond, for I perceive\n",
      "1339: A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.\n",
      "1340: What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?\n",
      "1341: Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.\n",
      "1342: What, can you do me greater harm than hate?\n",
      "1343: Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!\n",
      "1344: Am not I HERMIA? are not you LYSANDER?\n",
      "1345: I am as fair now as I was erewhile.\n",
      "1346: Since night you loved me; yet since night you left\n",
      "1347: me:\n",
      "1348: Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--\n",
      "1349: In earnest, shall I say?\n",
      "1350: Ay, by my life;\n",
      "1351: And never did desire to see thee more.\n",
      "1352: Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;\n",
      "1353: Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest\n",
      "1354: That I do hate thee and love HELENA.\n",
      "1355: O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!\n",
      "1356: You thief of love! what, have you come by night\n",
      "1357: And stolen my love's heart from him?\n",
      "1358: Fine, i'faith!\n",
      "1359: Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,\n",
      "1360: No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear\n",
      "1361: Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?\n",
      "1362: Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!\n",
      "1363: Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.\n",
      "1364: Now I perceive that she hath made compare\n",
      "1365: Between our statures; she hath urged her height;\n",
      "1366: And with her personage, her tall personage,\n",
      "1367: Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.\n",
      "1368: And are you grown so high in his esteem;\n",
      "1369: Because I am so dwarfish and so low?\n",
      "1370: How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;\n",
      "1371: How low am I? I am not yet so low\n",
      "1372: But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.\n",
      "1373: I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,\n",
      "1374: Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;\n",
      "1375: I have no gift at all in shrewishness;\n",
      "1376: I am a right maid for my cowardice:\n",
      "1377: Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,\n",
      "1378: Because she is something lower than myself,\n",
      "1379: That I can match her.\n",
      "1380: Lower! hark, again.\n",
      "1381: Good HERMIA, do not be so bitter with me.\n",
      "1382: I evermore did love you, HERMIA,\n",
      "1383: Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;\n",
      "1384: Save that, in love unto DEMETRIUS,\n",
      "1385: I told him of your stealth unto this wood.\n",
      "1386: He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;\n",
      "1387: But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me\n",
      "1388: To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:\n",
      "1389: And now, so you will let me quiet go,\n",
      "1390: To Athens will I bear my folly back\n",
      "1391: And follow you no further: let me go:\n",
      "1392: You see how simple and how fond I am.\n",
      "1393: Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?\n",
      "1394: A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.\n",
      "1395: What, with LYSANDER?\n",
      "1396: With DEMETRIUS.\n",
      "1397: Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, HELENA.\n",
      "1398: No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.\n",
      "1399: O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!\n",
      "1400: She was a vixen when she went to school;\n",
      "1401: And though she be but little, she is fierce.\n",
      "1402: 'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!\n",
      "1403: Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?\n",
      "1404: Let me come to her.\n",
      "1405: Get you gone, you dwarf;\n",
      "1406: You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;\n",
      "1407: You bead, you acorn.\n",
      "1408: You are too officious\n",
      "1409: In her behalf that scorns your services.\n",
      "1410: Let her alone: speak not of HELENA;\n",
      "1411: Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend\n",
      "1412: Never so little show of love to her,\n",
      "1413: Thou shalt aby it.\n",
      "1414: Now she holds me not;\n",
      "1415: Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,\n",
      "1416: Of thine or mine, is most in HELENA.\n",
      "1417: Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.\n",
      "1418: Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS\n",
      "1419: You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:\n",
      "1420: Nay, go not back.\n",
      "1421: I will not trust you, I,\n",
      "1422: Nor longer stay in your curst company.\n",
      "1423: Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,\n",
      "1424: My legs are longer though, to run away.\n",
      "1426: I am amazed, and know not what to say.\n",
      "1428: This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,\n",
      "1429: Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.\n",
      "1430: Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.\n",
      "1431: Did not you tell me I should know the man\n",
      "1432: By the Athenian garment be had on?\n",
      "1433: And so far blameless proves my enterprise,\n",
      "1434: That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;\n",
      "1435: And so far am I glad it so did sort\n",
      "1436: As this their jangling I esteem a sport.\n",
      "1437: Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:\n",
      "1438: Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;\n",
      "1439: The starry welkin cover thou anon\n",
      "1440: With drooping fog as black as Acheron,\n",
      "1441: And lead these testy rivals so astray\n",
      "1442: As one come not within another's way.\n",
      "1443: Like to LYSANDER sometime frame thy tongue,\n",
      "1444: Then stir DEMETRIUS up with bitter wrong;\n",
      "1445: And sometime rail thou like DEMETRIUS;\n",
      "1446: And from each other look thou lead them thus,\n",
      "1447: Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep\n",
      "1448: With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:\n",
      "1449: Then crush this herb into LYSANDER's eye;\n",
      "1450: Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,\n",
      "1451: To take from thence all error with his might,\n",
      "1452: And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.\n",
      "1453: When they next wake, all this derision\n",
      "1454: Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,\n",
      "1455: And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,\n",
      "1456: With league whose date till death shall never end.\n",
      "1457: Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,\n",
      "1458: I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;\n",
      "1459: And then I will her charmed eye release\n",
      "1460: From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.\n",
      "1461: My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,\n",
      "1462: For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,\n",
      "1463: And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;\n",
      "1464: At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,\n",
      "1465: Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,\n",
      "1466: That in crossways and floods have burial,\n",
      "1467: Already to their wormy beds are gone;\n",
      "1468: For fear lest day should look their shames upon,\n",
      "1469: They willfully themselves exile from light\n",
      "1470: And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.\n",
      "1471: But we are spirits of another sort:\n",
      "1472: I with the morning's love have oft made sport,\n",
      "1473: And, like a forester, the groves may tread,\n",
      "1474: Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,\n",
      "1475: Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,\n",
      "1476: Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.\n",
      "1477: But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:\n",
      "1478: We may effect this business yet ere day.\n",
      "1480: Up and down, up and down,\n",
      "1481: I will lead them up and down:\n",
      "1482: I am fear'd in field and town:\n",
      "1483: Goblin, lead them up and down.\n",
      "1484: Here comes one.\n",
      "1485: Re-enter LYSANDER\n",
      "1486: Where art thou, proud DEMETRIUS? speak thou now.\n",
      "1487: Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?\n",
      "1488: I will be with thee straight.\n",
      "1489: Follow me, then,\n",
      "1490: To plainer ground.\n",
      "1492: Re-enter DEMETRIUS\n",
      "1493: LYSANDER! speak again:\n",
      "1494: Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?\n",
      "1495: Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?\n",
      "1496: Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,\n",
      "1497: Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,\n",
      "1498: And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;\n",
      "1499: I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled\n",

      "1697: Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,\n",
      "1698: The skies, the fountains, every region near\n",
      "1699: Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard\n",
      "1700: So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.\n",
      "1701: My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,\n",
      "1702: So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung\n",
      "1703: With ears that sweep away the morning dew;\n",
      "1704: Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;\n",
      "1705: Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,\n",
      "1706: Each under each. A cry more tuneable\n",
      "1707: Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,\n",
      "1708: In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:\n",

      "1712: This HELENA, old Nedar's HELENA:\n",
      "1713: I wonder of their being here together.\n",
      "1714: No doubt they rose up early to observe\n",
      "1715: The rite of May, and hearing our intent,\n",
      "1716: Came here in grace our solemnity.\n",
      "1717: But speak, EGEUS; is not this the day\n",
      "1718: That HERMIA should give answer of her choice?\n",
      "1719: It is, my lord.\n",
      "1720: Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.\n",

      "1725: I pray you all, stand up.\n",
      "1726: I know you two are rival enemies:\n",
      "1727: How comes this gentle concord in the world,\n",
      "1728: That hatred is so far from jealousy,\n",
      "1729: To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?\n",
      "1730: My lord, I shall reply amazedly,\n",
      "1731: Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,\n",
      "1732: I cannot truly say how I came here;\n",
      "1733: But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,\n",
      "1734: And now do I bethink me, so it is,--\n",
      "1735: I came with HERMIA hither: our intent\n",
      "1736: Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,\n",
      "1737: Without the peril of the Athenian law.\n",
      "1738: Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:\n",
      "1739: I beg the law, the law, upon his head.\n",
      "1740: They would have stolen away; they would, DEMETRIUS,\n",
      "1741: Thereby to have defeated you and me,\n",
      "1742: You of your wife and me of my consent,\n",
      "1743: Of my consent that she should be your wife.\n",
      "1744: My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,\n",
      "1745: Of this their purpose hither to this wood;\n",
      "1746: And I in fury hither follow'd them,\n",
      "1747: Fair HELENA in fancy following me.\n",
      "1748: But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--\n",
      "1749: But by some power it is,--my love to HERMIA,\n",
      "1750: Melted as the snow, seems to me now\n",
      "1751: As the remembrance of an idle gaud\n",
      "1752: Which in my childhood I did dote upon;\n",
      "1753: And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,\n",
      "1754: The object and the pleasure of mine eye,\n",
      "1755: Is only HELENA. To her, my lord,\n",
      "1756: Was I betroth'd ere I saw HERMIA:\n",
      "1757: But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;\n",
      "1758: But, as in health, come to my natural taste,\n",
      "1759: Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,\n",
      "1760: And will for evermore be true to it.\n",
      "1761: Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:\n",
      "1762: Of this discourse we more will hear anon.\n",
      "1763: EGEUS, I will overbear your will;\n",
      "1764: For in the temple by and by with us\n",
      "1765: These couples shall eternally be knit:\n",
      "1766: And, for the morning now is something worn,\n",
      "1767: Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.\n",
      "1768: Away with us to Athens; three and three,\n",
      "1769: We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.\n",
      "1770: Come, HIPPOLYTA.\n",
      "1771: Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train\n",
      "1772: These things seem small and undistinguishable,\n",
      "1773: Methinks I see these things with parted eye,\n",
      "1774: When every thing seems double.\n",
      "1775: So methinks:\n",
      "1776: And I have found DEMETRIUS like a jewel,\n",
      "1777: Mine own, and not mine own.\n",
      "1778: Are you sure\n",
      "1779: That we are awake? It seems to me\n",
      "1780: That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think\n",
      "1781: The duke was here, and bid us follow him?\n",
      "1782: Yea; and my father.\n",
      "1783: And HIPPOLYTA.\n",
      "1784: And he did bid us follow to the temple.\n",
      "1785: Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him\n",
      "1786: And by the way let us recount our dreams.\n",

      "1815: If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes\n",
      "1816: not forward, doth it?\n",
      "1817: It is not possible: you have not a man in all\n",
      "1818: Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.\n",
      "1819: No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft\n",
      "1820: man in Athens.\n",
      "1821: Yea and the best person too; and he is a very\n",
